Hi,

I wanted to update you on a recent analysis we performed on our receipt, users and brand data. We've identified some 
data quality issues that could potentially impact our reporting and analytics. Here are some:

We found some missing values, Invalid characters, invalid length of barcodes, duplicate id's, earning points without spending amount in our datasets.
we discovered these issues by running some SQL queries against our data. Below are some sample issues we found

1. We have some missing values in all three datasets (receipt, users, brand).
2. Some Brandcodes have barcodes instead of Brand code name.
example:
_id							barcode			brandcode
5d6413156d5f3b23d1bc790a	511111205012	511111205012
3. In Brand dataset we have Invalid Characters in name.
example:
_id							name
5fb6adb8be37ce522e165cb8	LotriminÂ®
5da6071ea60b87376833e34d	Alka-SeltzerÂ®
4. some users who finished transaction by spending Zero but earned Points.
example:
_id		pointsEarned	totalspent	rewardsReceiptStatus
5ff36dcc0a720f05230005b1	55	0	FINISHED
5ff371130a7214ada10005aa	100	0	FINISHED
5ff36ad40a7214ada1000585	55	0	FINISHED
5. We have invalid length of barcodes in receipt datasets
example:
_id							barcode	barcode_length
5ff1e1eb0a720f0523000575	4011	4
5ff1e1bb0a720f052300056b	4011	4
5ff1e1bb0a720f052300056b	28400642255	11
5ff1e1a40a720f0523000569	46000832517	11

We need to know about below questions to reslove the issues.

Are there instances where detailed item information is missing or incomplete?
What are the expected lengths for barcodes in our system?
users data has duplicate id's are these expected?
Invalid characters that are present in Brands name,How do users typically interact with our systems, and where might they introduce these characters?
Why we are using barcodes for some barndcode names.

We do often get failures in our production environment due to these issues which results in low performance of our system. 
We can manually alter the data for now to run the batch loads but we need to address the issues that was mentioned in this mail to avoid failures
in our production environment which inturn enhances the performance of our system.

By addressing these data quality issues proactively, we can enhance the accuracy and reliability of our data, leading to better decision-making and insights for our business.

Please let me know if you have any questions or if there's a good time to discuss this further.

Best regards,
Naveen.
